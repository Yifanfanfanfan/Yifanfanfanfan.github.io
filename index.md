# Biography


Welcome! **Yifan (Evelyn) Gong** is a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, supervised by [Prof. Yanzhi Wang](https://web.northeastern.edu/yanzhiwang/#_ga=2.133348103.863566394.1694570386-1581901161.1692209067). She received the B.S. degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Xidian University and the M.A.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto. Her research vision is in general Artificial Intelligence (AI) system with the objective of facilitating Deep Learning (DL) on various edge devices and bridging the gap between the algorithm innovations and hardware performance optimizations by a hardware and software co-design approach, which includes energy-efficient deep learning and artificial intelligence systems and accelerations of deep neural networks including large-scale models for AIGC.
